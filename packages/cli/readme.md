![Cloud Local Storage](./packages/app/public/github-banner.png)

Serverless storage exposed via simple, familiar API.

Need to store some JSON real quick and don't feel like setting up a database for it?

Cloud Local Storage offers a simple `get` and `set` API, very similar to `localStorage`'s that keeps the data you provide it over at Firebase.

There's a Node SDK, and web API and also a CLI Tool that helps you manage you storages.

Cloud Local Storage is free, and opensourced, and will always be.
